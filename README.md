## Cat and Mouse
This project is an examination of the concepts of distance and relative motion and how these concepts can reasonably extend beyond our intuitive understanding of them in 2 and 3 dimensions.

### Description
This program models the positions of a ***cat*** and a ***mouse*** as one chases the other through an **n**-dimensional space. As the cat is chasing the mouse, its path depends on the mouses movements, and it fallows a few simple rules.
1. If the mouse;s velocity vector has no component in the direction of the cat, the the cat,s velocity vector is equal to the mouse,s velocity vector. In other words, if the mouse is not moving at all towards the cat, the the cat parallels the mouses path.
